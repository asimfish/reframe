Disentanglement is to identify and separate the factors of variation in data~\cite{bengio2013representation} with some codes. Most existing works on disentanglement are solely built upon some intuitions, e.g. the latent variables should be statistically independent. In this work, we transform these intuitions into a rigorous mathematical formulation from an information-theoretic perspective and then propose an information-theoretic definition of disentanglement. Then we derive some necessary conditions from our proposed definition, including the independence and conditional independence of codes. To our knowledge, there are few works to demonstrate the necessity of conditional independence for disentanglement. Moreover, based on the proposed definition, we propose three novel metrics to measure different aspects of disentanglement. Experimental results show that violating conditional independence will lead to a sharp decline in disentanglement, and our proposed metrics can provide a proper evaluation of disentanglement.
